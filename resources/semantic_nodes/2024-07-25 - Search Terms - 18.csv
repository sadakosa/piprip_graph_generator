Human-Computer Interaction: Computer Science-Based Breakdown,1
1. Interaction Design,2
User Interface (UI) Design: The process of making interfaces in software with a focus on looks or style.,3
Graphical User Interface (GUI): A form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons.,4
Voice User Interface (VUI): Interfaces that allow users to interact with a system through voice commands.,4
Tangible User Interface (TUI): Interfaces where users interact with digital information through the physical environment.,4
"User Experience (UX) Design: The process of enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction.",3
Information Architecture: The structural design of shared information environments.,4
Wireframes: Visual guides that represent the skeletal framework of a UI.,4
2. Input Devices,2
Keyboard: A device used to input text and characters.,3
Mouse: A pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface.,3
Touchscreen: A display that can detect the location of touches within the display area.,3
"Motion Sensors: Devices that detect physical movement, often used in gaming and VR.",3
Voice Recognition Systems: Systems that interpret and process human speech.,3
3. Output Devices,2
Monitor: A display device for visual output from a computer.,3
Speakers: Devices for audio output.,3
Printers: Devices that produce physical copies of digital documents.,3
Haptic Feedback Devices: Devices that provide tactile feedback to the user.,3
4. Interaction Paradigms,2
Direct Manipulation: Interaction style that involves manipulating objects on the screen.,3
Drag and Drop: A pointing device gesture in which the user selects an object by grabbing it and dragging it to a different location.,4
"WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer): A paradigm for user interfaces based on the idea of windows, icons, menus, and pointing devices.",3
"Natural User Interfaces (NUI): Interfaces that allow users to interact using natural behaviors, like gestures and voice commands.",3

Assistive Technologies: Devices or software designed to assist people with disabilities.,3
Screen Readers: Software that reads text displayed on a screen aloud.,4
Braille Displays: Devices that provide a tactile output for blind users.,4
"Universal Design: Designing products to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without adaptation.",3
7. Cognitive Models,2
"GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection Rules): A model for human-computer interaction that describes a user's cognitive structure.",3
Fitts' Law: A predictive model of human movement in HCI.,3
Hick's Law: The time it takes for a person to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.,3
